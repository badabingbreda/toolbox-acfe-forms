# Toolbox ACF Extended Forms
ACF Extended is a must have plugin if you're serious about your ACF development. One of the big advantages is that you can create frontend editing with improved user experience. You can create forms with better placement of the fields, styled to your own needs.

With Toolbox ACF Extended Forms you can use Twig templates to render the forms. This means you can use logic to show/hide fields based on role, logged in/out - or just about anything really - easily.
